# AI-Driven_Garbage_Classification_for_Efficient_Waste_Management

This project focuses on training a ResNet50 deep learning model using PyTorch for image classification tasks. The model is trained and validated using a custom training loop, ensuring efficient learning and performance evaluation. The implementation includes essential components such as data loading, preprocessing, training, validation, and inference.

The model leverages pretrained ResNet50 weights to improve accuracy and reduce training time. Training is conducted using Adam or SGD optimizers, depending on the requirements. The project is designed to be compatible with both CPU and GPU, ensuring flexibility in different computing environments. The dataset is processed using DataLoader, applying transformations to enhance generalization.

To ensure smooth execution, users need to have Python 3.x, PyTorch, Torchvision, Matplotlib, and NumPy installed. The project is structured into multiple files, including model.py for defining the ResNet50 architecture, train.py for training and evaluation logic, dataset.py for handling data loading, and utils.py for various helper functions.

The training process involves initializing the model, defining the loss function and optimizer, and iterating through multiple epochs to improve model performance. Validation is performed after each epoch to monitor progress, and the trained model can be used for inference on new images. If the dataset is large, GPU acceleration is recommended by moving the model and data to CUDA using model.to(device).

Common issues that may arise include dataset loading errors, mismatched device settings, and deprecated parameters. If a warning related to pretrained weights appears, it is recommended to use weights=ResNet50_Weights.DEFAULT instead. The project follows best practices in deep learning model training and evaluation, ensuring high performance and accuracy.

This project is built using PyTorch and Torchvision, leveraging their powerful deep learning capabilities. It serves as a foundation for training ResNet50 on custom datasets and can be further optimized for specific classification tasks.
